A Civilization clone made for UVic's SEng 271 class by [Jeremy Mohr](https://github.com/Jemeyr?source=cc), [Daniel Conti](https://github.com/insaneHoshi?source=cc), [Colton Phillips](https://github.com/ColtonPhillips?source=cc), and [Tom Gibson](https://github.com/Beyamor).

Hopefully we've become much better programmers since then.
